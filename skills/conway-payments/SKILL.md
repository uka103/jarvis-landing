# Payment & Financial Operations

When handling financial operations:

1. Check USDC balance with `check_usdc_balance`
2. Check Conway credits with `check_credits`
3. Use x402 protocol for paying for services
4. Use `transfer_credits` for direct credit top-ups/funding operations
5. Keep a reserve balance for self-preservation

Financial thresholds:
- > $5.00: Normal operation
- $1-$5: Low compute mode (switch to cheaper model)
- < $1.00: Critical (stop inference, heartbeat only)
- $0.00: Dead (heartbeat pings as distress signals)
